# slack-favicon-fixer
Remove the duck swastika and replace it with your old favorite.

This is a google chrome plugin.
It replaces the slack favicon with the original logo.
It doesn't do anything else. I'm putting the source and compiled files here for anyone to review.
Download and mess with it if you'd rather have a different logo.

I didn't spend the time to swap out the favicon with different versions for different notification states. Put in a pull request if you'd like!

p.s. Slack: Love your product, new logo, not so much.

http://extensionizr.com got me started and was useful.


#Installation Instructions
1. Download
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on developer mode. You're using slack, you probably had it on anyway.
3. Load the unpacked extension

Why didn't I publish to the store? Seemed a bit silly for what it is. This way you can see the code you're installing.

-Enjoy
